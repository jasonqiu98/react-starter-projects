Key points

- Creating a state by `useState()`
- Lifting up states to the parent node
- Using the `map()` function on an array
- New HTML tags: `<article>`, `<main>` and `<section>`

Some additional hints/caveats

- The curly braces `{}` are used to wrap all the Vanilla JS expressions. JSX expressions should NOT be wrapped around.
- `import { useState } from 'react'`
- Since all the JS files can be combined to a giant one eventually, we can use `index.css` to define all the CSS styles, include the file to `index.js` and then use any of the defined styles freely within the whole project.
